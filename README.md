# hello-world
My place to store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others ;)
A little too late, maybe, I decided to start programming and this way, who knows, solve problems.
One of the first things to do, of course, is to get a gihub account :)
And now fingers crossed that I will keep up and make a success of my new beautiful journey!
